                ceiba tree that holds a significant place in the history and

              <h4>A symbol of freedom</h4>
              <p>
                The Cotton Tree has played a prominent role in the history of
                Freetown and Sierra Leone. It is believed that the tree was the
                site of the first settlement of freed slaves in the late 18th
                century, who gathered under the tree to find refuge and freedom.
                The tree became a symbol of hope and liberation, and it was
                often used as a meeting place for anti-colonial movements and
                political rallies.
